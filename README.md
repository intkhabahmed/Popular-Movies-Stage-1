# Popular-Movies-Stage-1

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. 
In this project, youâ€™ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.</p>

<b>This app will:</b>
<ol>
<li>Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.</li>
<li>Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:</li>
<ol><li>The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated</li></ol>
<li>Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:</li>
<ol><li>original title</li>
<li>movie poster image thumbnail</li>
<li>A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)</li>
<li>user rating (called vote_average in the api)</li>
<li>release date</li>
</ol></ol>

<h3>Steps to run the app</h3>
<p>Make a string resource named "api_key" and put your api key there, then you can run the app</p>
<h4>You can get your api key by signing up here <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org">https://www.themoviedb.org</a></h4>
